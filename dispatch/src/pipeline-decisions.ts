 * that drove each advance. So a ticket that flowed through every agent
 * arrives in Done carrying every `ready:*` from the trail. The auto-merge
 * path strips pipeline labels, but only after `gh pr merge` succeeds —
 * doc-only tickets, manually-merged PRs, and closed-as-won't-fix never
 * get cleaned. `runClosedSweep` (which moves closed-but-not-Done tickets
 * to Done) also doesn't strip. This pass closes the gap.
 *
 * Symmetric in spirit with `decideReworkRoutes`: rework routing returns
 * `labelsToStrip` for backward column moves; this returns `labelsToStrip`
 * for the terminal column. The asymmetry between auto-advance (no strip)
 * and rework (strip) was the root cause; cleanup here re-establishes the
 * invariant that no ticket sits in a final-state column with stale
 * pipeline labels.
 *
 * Strips:
 *   - any `ready:`/`wip:`/`error:`/`needs-rework:` label (`isPipelineLabel`)
 *   - any `rework-count:N` label (counter — reset so a re-opened ticket
 *     starts fresh rather than carrying stale rounds toward the loop
 *     threshold)
 *
 * Does NOT touch:
 *   - `size:`, `priority:`, `merged`, or any free-form tag
 *   - the `merged` label specifically — its semantic is "PR was merged,"
 *     set only by the auto-merge path; reaching Done some other way
 *     shouldn't grant it
 *
 * Skips items with `issueNumber <= 0` (epics, virtual items) — same as

 * issue, routes back, fix lands, advances). A second round means the
 * fix wasn't right. A third round is unusual but defensible. A fourth
 * round is the loop pattern Pyrycode #41 hit (6 dispatches, ~$4
