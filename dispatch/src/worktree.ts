 * output is treated as clean — guards against false positives from
 * trailing newlines or shell padding.

// --------- Codegraph worktree integration ---------

/**
 * The decision shape returned by `decideCodegraphSymlink`. The caller
 * applies the side effect (symlinkSync) and the log line based on the
 * `action` and `reason`.
 *
 * - `symlink` + `ready`: caller should `symlinkSync(source, dest)`
 * - `skip` + `already-present`: dst exists; do nothing, don't warn
 * - `skip` + `no-source`: source index missing; warn so operator
 *   bootstraps via `codegraph init -i` in the canonical repo

/**
 * Decide whether to symlink the canonical repo's `.codegraph/` index
 * into a freshly created worktree.
 *
 * **Why a symlink at all:** the dispatcher creates a worktree per
 * dispatched ticket (`pyrycode/.pyrycode-worktrees/<agent>-<n>/`).
 * Each worktree is a fresh checkout — `git worktree add` does not
 * carry untracked files into the new tree, and `.codegraph/` is
 * gitignored. An agent spawned in the worktree with codegraph in its
 * `allowedTools` would launch the codegraph MCP server with cwd =
 * worktree dir, find no `.codegraph/`, and return empty results for
 * every query. The agent then silently falls back to grep, paying
 * for the codegraph tool surface in tokens without getting any of
 * the value.
 *
 * **Soft-fail on no-source:** if the canonical repo hasn't been
 * indexed yet, we don't fail the dispatch. Agents still run; they
 * just lose codegraph for that ticket. The warning surfaces the
 * setup gap so the operator knows to run `codegraph init -i`.
 *
 * **Idempotent:** if the destination already exists (previous run
 * left a symlink, or an operator dropped a real dir there), leave
 * it alone. Re-creating would either be a no-op or destroy
 * intentional state.
 *
 * Pure decision; the caller (in dispatch.ts) does the `existsSync`
 * checks, the `symlinkSync` call, and the log/warn output.

// --------- Worktree branch setup ---------

/**
 * Decide what to do with a feature branch before creating its worktree.
 *
 * The dispatcher's earlier behaviour was: if the local ref already exists
 * (from a prior dispatch), reuse it AS-IS. That breaks when someone pushes
 * to `origin/<branch>` out-of-band between dispatches (e.g., manual triage
 * worktree, hot-fix). Local stayed stale, worktree got the old commit, the
 * agent ran on out-of-date code. Surfaced 2026-05-07 (#155 code-review).
 *
 * Origin is the source of truth: if local is behind, fast-forward; if
 * local has commits not in origin, that's an integrity error (a prior
 * dispatch failed to push and we never noticed) and requires human triage.

// --------- Worktree introspection ---------

/**
 * Parse `git worktree list --porcelain` output and return the worktree
 * directories (if any) currently checked out at the given branch.
 *
 * `git worktree add <path> <branch>` fails with "fatal: '<branch>' is already
 * checked out at '<other-path>'" when the branch is in use elsewhere — even
 * if `<path>` is fresh. The dispatcher's stale-worktree cleanup at the start
 * of `dispatchToAgent` only handles the same-path case (`worktreeDir`); it
 * misses orphan worktrees on the same branch under different paths (a prior
 * cycle's `architect-100` left over when this cycle wants `developer-100`).
 *
 * Surfaced 2026-05-08 review (#5). The orphan blocks all future dispatches
 * on the affected branch with `error:<agent>`, indefinitely, until a human
 * runs `git worktree remove --force` by hand.
 *
 * Porcelain format (one record per worktree, blank-line separated):
 *
 *     worktree /path/to/wt
 *     HEAD <sha>
 *     branch refs/heads/<branch>
 *
 * Detached HEADs surface as `detached` (no `branch` line). Bare repos as
 * `bare`. Either way we don't match (no branch to compare).
 *
 * Pure function over the porcelain string; no I/O. Tests in lib.test.ts.

 * pyrycode-mobile-agents → pyrycode-mobile, pyrycode-relay-agents →
 * pyrycode-relay.
 *
 * Historical note: original code had `agentsRepoRoot + "../pyrycode"`,
 * which silently "worked" only because `agentsRepoRoot` was *also*
 * buggy and pointed at the pyrycode root. Once that bug was fixed,
 * this one surfaced — first dispatcher run after the fix tried
