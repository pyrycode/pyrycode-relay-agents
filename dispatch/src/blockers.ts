/**
 * True if any of the listed blockers is still OPEN.
 *
 * Uses GitHub's first-class `addBlockedBy` relationship (queryable as
 * `Issue.blockedBy` in GraphQL, visible in the issue UI as a "Blocked by
 * #N" badge). The dispatcher skips dispatch on any ticket where this
 * returns true — a blocked ticket can't make progress until its
 * dependencies close.
 *
 * Avoids the retry-loop class of failures (Pyrycode #41 hit this 6 times,
 * burning ~$4 of dev tokens, before the dev agent self-halted by
 * setting `error:developer`). Native `blockedBy` makes the constraint
 * structural — survives across runs, visible in the GitHub UI, and
 * doesn't require a custom label scheme.

/**
 * True if this dispatch attempt should be skipped because the ticket
 * has any open blocker. Applies uniformly to ALL agents — including PO.
 *
 * **PO is no longer exempted (2026-05-08).** The earlier design exempted
 * PO on the rationale that refinement is "cheap prep work" — but PO
 * actually refines from the issue body PLUS the docs (`docs/PROJECT-MEMORY.md`,
 * `docs/knowledge/INDEX.md`, `docs/knowledge/features/*.md`). The
 * Documentation agent runs LAST in the pipeline, so the docs only
 * reflect a ticket's changes after that ticket auto-merges to main.
 *
 * Result of the bypass: when PO refined a blocked ticket, it read docs
 * that didn't yet describe the upstream's API / sentinels / files.
 * Refinements baked stale assumptions that either propagated into the
 * dependent's body verbatim (sometimes wrong post-merge) or produced a
 * less-grounded body that architect had to bounce back via
 * `needs-rework:po`. Net cost was throughput-negative for tight chains
 * (refactors, dependent slices), where the upstream API IS the subject
 * of the upstream ticket.
 *
 * Now: blocked tickets sit in Backlog without `ready:po` until the
 * blocker closes. PO refines once with current docs. Cycle delay is
 * one PO turn (~60s, ~$0.20-0.50) per dependency relationship — bounded
 * and deterministic.
 *
 * Auto-advance from Backlog → In Architecture also respects open
 * blockers (see `decideAutoAdvance`).
 *
 * See [[Lessons#PO refines from docs; docs lag the code; PO bypass on
 * blockers ships stale refinements (#198/#199, 2026-05-08)]] for full
 * rationale + the generalizable pattern (informational dependencies vs
 * API dependencies in any pipeline).

/**
 * True if this agent is expected to produce commits during a normal

 * this is true AND the post-run branch is 0 ahead of `main`.
 *
 * Reads `agent.producesCommits` (declared in types.ts). Distinct from
 * `shouldUseWorktree`: code-review uses a worktree (reads code) but
 * never commits — its output is PR comments via `gh pr review`.
 *
 * Surfaced by relay #5 (2026-05-08): architect refused to spec without
 * blocker resolution, developer refused to code without spec, code-review
 * couldn't apply `needs-rework:developer` because that label didn't
 * exist in the relay repo — and the dispatcher march-marched the ticket
 * across every column to "Done" with `feature/5` unchanged from main.
 * The fix is deterministic: don't trust the agent's prose about whether
 * work happened; verify by counting commits.

 * falsely flagging a successful run as empty).
 *
 * The git command itself either succeeds with a single integer line or
 * exits non-zero (then `execSync` throws and the caller's `catch`
 * leaves `commitsAhead` at -1). This function only exists so the

/**
 * True iff the dispatcher should treat this agent's post-run branch

 *   - `useWorktree` gate (no worktree = no branch to count against)
 *   - `!saferSalvaged` gate (salvage path manages its own labeling)
 *   - error-handling around the `git rev-list` call (treat throw as -1)
 *
 * Returns false on negative `commitsAhead` (parse failed or git errored)
 * — the dispatcher prefers to advance the ticket and let downstream
 * gates catch the issue rather than block on uncertain state.
